# Lexicographer — Game Summary

**Lexicographer** is an idle/incremental word game where you collect ink, press letter tiles, and inscribe valid English words into a lexicon (dictionary). When ready, you "publish" the lexicon to earn **Quills** (prestige currency), then reset and start a new round — stronger each time.

## Core Loop

1. **Ink Wells** — up to 5 wells passively fill with ink. Collect manually (with crit chance for bonus ink) or hire managers to auto-collect. Upgradeable: fill rate, capacity, crit chance, crit multiplier.

2. **Letter Presses** — up to 5 presses run 10-second production cycles yielding random letter tiles (weighted by English frequency). Can produce **special tiles**: Double Letter, Triple Letter, Double Word, Triple Word, Golden (★), and Lexicoin Wildcard (◈ — substitutes for any letter). Managers auto-restart idle presses.

3. **Word Inscription** — drag letters onto a board, form a valid English word, and spend ink to add it to your lexicon. Words are scored Scrabble-style with tile bonuses stacking multiplicatively. Ink cost rises with each word added.

4. **Publishing (Prestige)** — requires 10+ words. Converts the lexicon into Quills based on: number of **new** unique words, Lexicoin count, top-10 word scores, and cosmetic book bonuses. Resets ink, letters, wells, presses, and all per-device upgrades.

## Key Features

- **Monkeys with Typewriters** — unlockable monkeys that auto-find words from previously published lexicons on a timer. Upgradeable: count (up to 20), find chance, efficiency (faster timer), precision & artistry (bonus tiles on found words).

- **Daily Missions** — 3 per UTC day (e.g. "inscribe 10 words", "publish a lexicon"). Reward Quills on claim.

- **Achievements** — tiered lifetime milestones (ink collected, unique words found, lexicons published, wildcard usage). Quill rewards per tier.

- **Cosmetic Book Design** — covers (×1.00 to ×1.30 quill bonus) and page styles (×1.00 to ×1.15 bonus) change the visual book appearance and stack multiplicatively for up to ×1.495 on publish earnings.

- **Library** — browse all previously published lexicons as mini book covers. Click to re-read any past lexicon with full page-flip navigation.

- **Offline Progress** — simulates well filling, press completions, and monkey firings while the tab was closed.

- **Accounts & Cloud Save** — optional login syncs state to a backend (Express + SQLite). Unauthenticated play is in-memory only (refresh = reset).

- **IAP / Boosts** — Stripe-powered microtransactions for quill bundles, instant well fills, rare tiles, and premium cosmetics.

## Progression Arc

**Early** → One well, manual ink collection, spell simple words, first publish for a handful of quills.
**Mid** → Multiple wells/presses with managers, permanent upgrades accelerating each round, monkeys finding words.
**Late** → Fleets of 20 monkeys, astronomical ink rates (fmt goes up to vigintillions), thousands of published lexicons, premium cosmetics maximizing quill yield. Only **new** words earn publish bonuses, pushing vocabulary discovery.
