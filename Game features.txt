Tutorial notes:
Doesn't explain what a Lexicoin is
Should highlight the bits of interest and should only allow the player to actually select the letters it says
Publish button needs to ask for confirmation - should be the same pop up that already exists but now with another button that says "Publish"
When explaining the double letters bit, there should be a pop up that shows what each of the bonus tiles does
Overall should be way more hand-holdy
The actual text is really bad
Should highlight that there are other currencies
Should have a shop section
Should outline the drag and drop and click functionalities


Bugs:
Sample words button in debug menu doesnt work - makes game white screen
tap anywhere to continue after publishing doesnt close if you tap the pop up
Need to have a second confirmation stage for publication

Other bits to add:
