Quill Upgrades:

Monkey with a typewriter (100 quills) - adds words from previous lexicons to current one (with base tile scoring), base chance of 10% to add a word every 5 minutes, can be upgraded further with quills to get to 100% chance every 10 seconds.

Chain Reaction (1,000 quills) - Every ink collection done by a manager has a 5% chance of instantly refilling ink wells to 25%, can be upgraded to 50% chance of refilling to 50%

Tutorial notes:
Doesn't explain what a Lexicoin is
Should highlight the bits of interest and should only allow the player to actually select the letters it says
Publish button needs to ask for confirmation - should be the same pop up that already exists but now with another button that says "Publish"
When explaining the double letters bit, there should be a pop up that shows what each of the bonus tiles does
Overall should be way more hand-holdy
The actual text is really bad
Should highlight that there are other currencies
Should have a shop section
Should outline the drag and drop and click functionalities


Bugs:
When you go off the lexicon tab for a while and come back all of the monkeys procs have seemingly been stored and all go off creating a massive mess
